#PROBLEM STATEMENT:
PS 05 : "Silent Disease” Early Detection Engine
(Detect What Patients Don’t Even Know They Have)

#PROJECT NAME:
"HealthGuardAI"

## Overview
The **HealthGuardAI** is an AI-powered system designed to identify potential health risks **before symptoms become obvious**. It analyzes multiple subtle signals from patient data, including lab trends, lifestyle, stress levels, and family history, to provide **risk probabilities and preventive recommendations**.  

This system is aimed at helping both patients and doctors take early action, promoting **preventive healthcare** rather than reactive diagnosis.

## Features

- **Risk Probability Scores**: Instead of a simple yes/no, the system outputs a **risk percentage** for early-stage conditions.  
- **Multiple Input Signals**: Combines lab reports, lifestyle data, mental health indicators, and family history.  
- **Preventive Recommendations**: Suggests actionable steps for patients to reduce their risk.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based interface for easy data input and viewing results.

## Problem & Solution Fit
Many life-threatening diseases remain **undetected until advanced stages** due to mild or overlooked symptoms.  
This system addresses the gap by **aggregating non-obvious signals** to provide **early warnings**, helping clinicians and patients make **informed decisions**.

## Innovation & Creativity
- Early detection of “silent diseases” that patients are unaware of.
